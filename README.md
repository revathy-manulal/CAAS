# CaaS 
#Cloud storage services have become commercially popular due to overwhelming advantages. To provide ubiquitous always-on access, a cloud service provider (CSP) maintains multiple replicas for eachpiece of data on geographically distributed servers. A key problem of using the replication technique in clouds is that it is very expensive to achieve strong consistency on a worldwide scale. Consistency as a service(CaaS) model consists of a large data cloud  and multiple  small audit clouds. In the CaaS model,a data cloud is maintained by a CSP, and a group of users that constitute an audit cloud can verify whether the dta cloud provides the promised level of consistency or not. The two-level auditing architecture in the system only requires a loosely synchronized clock in the audit cloud and design algorithms to quantify the severity of violations with two metrics: the commonality of violations, and the staleness of the value of a read. Finally devise a heuristic auditing strategy(HAS) to reveal as many violations as possible.
